**Strengths of React Native**: 
  - Developer Availability. It's easier to hire developers with React Native skills (or cross-skill from React) than it is to hire native Swift/Kotlin developers.
  - Developer Productivity. Because one codebase can target both iOS and Android platforms, the effort to target both is effectively half when compared with pure native development. 
  - Performance
  - One-way Data Flow
  - Developer Experience
  - Transpilation
  - Productivity and Efficiency
  - Community Support
  - Open Source
  - Immediate Updates
- **Drawbacks of React Native**: A balanced look at some of the challenges associated with React Native, including:
  - Still not at v1
  - Requires Familiarity with React
  - Need to Learn Xcode/Android for Native Features
  - Additional Abstraction Layer


Builds: Can use EAS build 
Normally mobile apps stay relatively static between versions. If there's a typo in a release, you usually need a new version of the app which would be deployed to the app store in order to be released. This can be a slow process, due to store submission policies.
We should think about 'alpha' users. X number of people who get early access to a prerelease version.
